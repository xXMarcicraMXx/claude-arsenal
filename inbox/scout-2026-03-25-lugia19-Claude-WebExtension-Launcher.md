## Description

Creates a separate Claude Desktop instance with support for Web Extensions

## README Excerpt

# Claude Desktop WebExtension Installer

A custom installer for Claude Desktop that includes built-in extensions (and the ability to install your own).

**Note**: The extensions in question are _Web_ extensions! Not to be confused with Local MCPs, which the client also calls Extensions and come in the dxt format.

**Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial, third-party modification of Claude Desktop that enables extension support. By using this installer, you acknowledge that:
- You are doing so at your own risk and discretion
- This project is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Anthropic
- You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with all applicable terms and agreements

## Known limitations

### Windows requires admin perms
This is to make Cowork function. The app will block cowork if the application is not inside of C:\Program Files\WindowsApps, which requires admin permissions to be written to and read from.

### Cowork does not work on MacOS (Corrupt install)
This is because the app is signed, and cowork checks for the signature.
On windows, this is circumvented by not modifying the exe and instead using a .dll, but that cannot be done on MacOS.


I would recommend keeping a separate, unmodified install for it.

## Overview

This installer generates a modified version of the Claude Desktop client with extension support enabled. It creates a standalone installation that can coexist with the official Claude Desktop client, automatically keeping both the client and extensions up to date.

## Known Issues

### Extension not showing up

This can happen due to reasons I'm not really sure of. Restarting the application is enough.

### Windows defender flags it as malware

Yep, Waca- etc are a pretty common false positive. Pyinstaller-built exes used to also trigger it. There isn't really anything I can do about that.
<details>
<summary>How does patching work on windows?</summary>
Basically, it uses the fact that exes will load DLLs that are next to the exe first, to load a modified version.dll.
Its source code is inside the ClaudeDLL folder, but it basically just tells the exe that whatever hash app.asar has, it's the right one.
It's a way to circumvent the asar integrity check without modifying the exe itself, which is what I used to do (and it broke cowork).
</details>

### Refuses to open on MacOS (Insecure/Not Verified)
You might need to go to Settings -> Privacy and Security and click "Open anyway".

MacOS REALLY doesn't like apps that aren't notarized (aka, that haven't paid the 99$ apple tax).
Not much I can do. I can't afford the subscription, and even if I could, this wouldn't be allowed on the app store.

### First Launch Network Service Crash (macOS only)
On first launch, you might see a crash dialog about the network service. This is (likely) because the modified app needs Keychain permission to be granted, given that it uses an ad-hoc signature. Just ignore it.
