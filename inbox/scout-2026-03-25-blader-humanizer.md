## Overview

Based on [Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) guide, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. This comprehensive guide comes from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text.

The skill also includes a final "obviously AI generated" audit pass and a second rewrite, to catch lingering AI-isms in the first draft.
