## Install

Inside a Claude Code instance, run the following commands:

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**
```
/plugin marketplace add jarrodwatts/claude-hud
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Linux users: Click here first</strong></summary>

On Linux, `/tmp` is often a separate filesystem (tmpfs), which causes plugin installation to fail with:
```
EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted
```

**Fix**: Set TMPDIR before installing:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cache/tmp && TMPDIR=~/.cache/tmp claude
```

Then run the install command below in that session. This is a [Claude Code platform limitation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14799).

</details>

```
/plugin install claude-hud
```

**Step 3: Configure the statusline**
```
/claude-hud:setup
```

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Windows users: Click here if setup says no JavaScript runtime was found</strong></summary>

If setup says no JavaScript runtime was found on Windows, install one for your shell first. The simplest fallback is Node.js LTS:
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
Then restart your shell and run `/claude-hud:setup` again.

</details>

Done! Restart Claude Code to load the new statusLine config, then the HUD will appear.

On Windows, make that a full Claude Code restart after setup writes the new `statusLine` config.

## What is Claude HUD?

Claude HUD gives you better insights into what's happening in your Claude Code session.

| What You See | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Project path** | Know which project you're in (configurable 1-3 directory levels) |
| **Context health** | Know exactly how full your context window is before it's too late |
| **Tool activity** | Watch Claude read, edit, and search files as it happens |
| **Agent tracking** | See which subagents are running and what they're doing |
| **Todo progress** | Track task completion in real-time |

## What You See

### Default (2 lines)
```
[Opus] │ my-project git:(main*)
Context █████░░░░░ 45% │ Usage ██░░░░░░░░ 25% (1h 30m / 5h)
```
- **Line 1** — Model, provider/auth label when relevant (for example `Bedrock` or `API`), project path, git branch
- **Line 2** — Context bar (green → yellow → red) and usage rate limits

### Optional lines (enable via `/claude-hud:configure`)
```
◐ Edit: auth.ts | ✓ Read ×3 | ✓ Grep ×2        ← Tools activity
◐ explore [haiku]: Finding auth code (2m 15s)    ← Agent status
▸ Fix authentication bug (2/5)                   ← Todo progress
```
