## Description

Sub-agents for pi with Claude Code look and feel — parallel execution, live widget, custom agent types, mid-run steering and more ...

## README Excerpt

# @tintinweb/pi-subagents

A [pi](https://pi.dev) extension that brings **Claude Code-style autonomous sub-agents** to pi. Spawn specialized agents that run in isolated sessions — each with its own tools, system prompt, model, and thinking level. Run them in foreground or background, steer them mid-run, resume completed sessions, and define your own custom agent types.

> **Status:** Early release.

## Features

- **Claude Code look & feel** — same tool names, calling conventions, and UI patterns (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, `steer_subagent`) — feels native
- **Parallel background agents** — spawn multiple agents that run concurrently with automatic queuing (configurable concurrency limit, default 4) and smart group join (consolidated notifications)
- **Live widget UI** — persistent above-editor widget with animated spinners, live tool activity, token counts, and colored status icons
- **Conversation viewer** — select any agent in `/agents` to open a live-scrolling overlay of its full conversation (auto-follows new content, scroll up to pause)
- **Custom agent types** — define agents in `.pi/agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter: custom system prompts, model selection, thinking levels, tool restrictions
- **Mid-run steering** — inject messages into running agents to redirect their work without restarting
- **Session resume** — pick up where an agent left off, preserving full conversation context
- **Graceful turn limits** — agents get a "wrap up" warning before hard abort, producing clean partial results instead of cut-off output
- **Case-insensitive agent types** — `"explore"`, `"Explore"`, `"EXPLORE"` all work. Unknown types fall back to general-purpose with a note
- **Fuzzy model selection** — specify models by name (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`) instead of full IDs, with automatic filtering to only available/configured models
- **Context inheritance** — optionally fork the parent conversation into a sub-agent so it knows what's been discussed
- **Persistent agent memory** — three scopes (project, local, user) with automatic read-only fallback for agents without write tools
- **Git worktree isolation** — run agents in isolated repo copies; changes auto-committed to branches on completion
- **Skill preloading** — inject named skill files from `.pi/skills/` into agent system prompts
- **Tool denylist** — block specific tools via `disallowed_tools` frontmatter
- **Styled completion notifications** — background agent results render as themed, compact notification boxes (icon, stats, result preview) instead of raw XML. Expandable to show full output. Group completions render each agent individually
- **Event bus** — lifecycle events (`subagents:created`, `started`, `completed`, `failed`, `steered`) emitted via `pi.events`, enabling other e
