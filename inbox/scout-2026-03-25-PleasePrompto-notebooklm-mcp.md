# NotebookLM MCP Server

**Let your CLI agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex...) chat directly with NotebookLM for zero-hallucination answers based on your own notebooks**

## The Problem

When you tell Claude Code or Cursor to "search through my local documentation", here's what happens:
- **Massive token consumption**: Searching through documentation means reading multiple files repeatedly
- **Inaccurate retrieval**: Searches for keywords, misses context and connections between docs
- **Hallucinations**: When it can't find something, it invents plausible-sounding APIs
- **Expensive & slow**: Each question requires re-reading multiple files

## The Solution

Let your local agents chat directly with [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) — Google's **zero-hallucination knowledge base** powered by Gemini 2.5 that provides intelligent, synthesized answers from your docs.

```
Your Task → Local Agent asks NotebookLM → Gemini synthesizes answer → Agent writes correct code
```

**The real advantage**: No more manual copy-paste between NotebookLM and your editor. Your agent asks NotebookLM directly and gets answers straight back in the CLI. It builds deep understanding through automatic follow-ups — Claude asks multiple questions in sequence, each building on the last, getting specific implementation details, edge cases, and best practices. You can save NotebookLM links to your local library with tags and descriptions, and Claude automatically selects the relevant notebook based on your current task.

## Why NotebookLM, Not Local RAG?

| Approach | Token Cost | Setup Time | Hallucinations | Answer Quality |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Feed docs to Claude** | 🔴 Very high (multiple file reads) | Instant | Yes - fills gaps | Variable retrieval |
| **Web search** | 🟡 Medium | Instant | High - unreliable sources | Hit or miss |
| **Local RAG** | 🟡 Medium-High | Hours (embeddings, chunking) | Medium - retrieval gaps | Depends on setup |
| **NotebookLM MCP** | 🟢 Minimal | 5 minutes | **Zero** - refuses if unknown | Expert synthesis |
